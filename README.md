### Volume to HCP CIFTI
**Project url(s)**: [Volume to HCP surface](https://github.com/htwangtw/hcp-surface-format), 
[GIFTI API proposal](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel/issues/789)\
**Contributors**: [Hao-Ting Wang (HCP, visualisation, GIFTI)](https://github.com/htwangtw), 
[Gia H Ngo (HCP, visualisation)](https://github.com/ngohgia), 
[Chris Markiewicz (GIFTI)](https://github.com/effigies)\
**Description of project**: We want to put our preprocessed volume space data on to the HCP surface template. The goal is to have the whole workflow in Python. Due to the lack of high-level surface-based tools, we are also looking into solutions to GIFTI/CIFTI file IO and visualisation. The future goal is to provide more user-friendly tools to work with surface data in Python!\

**Description of project**: We are attempting to predict substance use using behavioral metrics from the HCP data with machine learning models. Many measures relate to substance use, but there’s little data available to guide the development of test batteries. The goal is to minimize patient burden without sacrificing predictive accuracy.\
