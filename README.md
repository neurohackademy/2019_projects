**Description of project**: Neurohackmap is a collection of scripts to visualize the change in NHA19 participants' world locations and research interests over time.\
**How to get involved**: For any help in code optimization, and/or to add alternative data visualizations, pull requests are welcome. Please get in touch with one of the contributors if you would like to request full access to the dataset.

### deGANerate

**Project url(s)**: [neurohack_dl_gan](https://github.com/jeffreydurieux/neurohack_dl_gan)\
**Contributors**: [Meltem Atay](https://github.com/meltemiatay), [Bastian David](https://github.com/bastiandavid), [Jeffrey Durieux](https://github.com/jeffreydurieux), [Alberto Lazari](https://github.com/lazaral), Steph Rossi, [Anna Truzzi](https://github.com/AnnaTruzzi), [Benjamin Wade](https://github.com/bscwade), [Suniyya A. Waraich](https://github.com/suniyya)\
**Description of project**: We are working on classifying a person's age group from an MRI scan, using deep learning techniques. At the same time, we are training a GAN that takes in young brains and makes them look old. ðŸ§ \
**How to get involved**: Say hi! ðŸ‘‹ Leave a note.


### Volume to HCP CIFTI
**Project url(s)**: [Volume to HCP surface](https://github.com/htwangtw/hcp-surface-format), 
[GIFTI API proposal](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel/issues/789)\
**Contributors**: [Hao-Ting Wang (HCP, visualisation, GIFTI)](https://github.com/htwangtw), 
[Gia H Ngo (HCP, visualisation)](https://github.com/ngohgia), 
[Chris Markiewicz (GIFTI)](https://github.com/effigies)\
**Description of project**: We want to put our preprocessed volume space data on to the HCP surface template. The goal is to have the whole workflow in Python. Due to the lack of high-level surface-based tools, we are also looking into solutions to GIFTI/CIFTI file IO and visualisation. The future goal is to provide more user-friendly tools to work with surface data in Python!\
**How to get involved**: You discuss the new GIFTI API under issues or help Gia withe the python workflow.
